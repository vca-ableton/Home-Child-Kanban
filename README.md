# Home/Child Kanban

****************************************************************************************************************************
14.6.2021 - From Victor
This is a fork that includes a special case for Campaign Members - A very specific, but valuable case for my stakeholders.

Shout outs to my Alma Mater, Appiphony! I ran into some Strike component code here while debugging :)
****************************************************************************************************************************


Home/Child Kanban or if the / or space is a problem HomeChildKanban
This component is fully native and highly customizable Drag & Drop Kanban view that can be configured for any related lists and home pages enabling you to choose the object, group and summarize its key differentiators & its records' key information to be shown on the kanban tiles.

Once configured, this component shows the list of all records grouped by a picklist value, summarized by a numeric field, change the group by value with just a Drag & Drop, navigate to the records shown in the kanban view, edit & delete them effortlessly! 
All this with some cool animations.
